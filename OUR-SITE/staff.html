            Her artistic philosophy (inspired by Mary Overlie's Six Viewpoints): obstacle as opportunity. By teaching kinesthetic awareness, she believes that empathy will also 
            develop which can create a more open, understanding and accepting community. The growth of a student does not stop in the classroom but rather should blend into their 
            own self-discovery.
